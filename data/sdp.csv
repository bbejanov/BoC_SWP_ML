"2010-10","Asset-Liability Management: An Overview","August 2010","Yuliya Romanyuk","FALSE","Foreign reserves management","G,G1,G11","Relevant literature on asset-liability management (ALM) is reviewed and  different ALM approaches are discussed that may be of interest to the Bank of  Canada for the purpose of modelling the Exchange Fund Account (EFA). The author  describes the general idea behind ALM, its pros and cons, risk measures and  strategies, as well as some applications. Particular attention is paid to  central bank reserves management. Ideas and suggestions are offered for future  research on the ALM framework for the EFA."
"2010-11","Evaluating the Effect of the Bank of Canada's Conditional Commitment Policy","August 2010","Zhongfang He","FALSE","Interest rates,Monetary policy implementation,Transmission of monetary policy","E,E4,E5,E6","The author evaluates the effect of the Bank of Canada's conditional commitment  regarding the target overnight rate on longer-term market interest rates by  taking into account the relationship between interest rates, inflation, and  unemployment rates. By using vector autoregressive models of monthly interest  rates, month-over-month inflation, and unemployment rates for Canada and the  United States, the author finds that the Canadian 1-year treasury bill rates and  1-year forward 3-month rates have generally been lower than their model-implied  values since April 2009, while the difference between the U.S. realized rates  and their model-implied values has been much smaller. The author also studies  the effect of the conditional commitment on longer-term government bond yields  with maturities of 2, 5, and 10 years, and finds lower actual Canadian  longer-term interest rates than their model-implied values, though their  difference diminishes as the maturities become longer. The evidence appears to  suggest that the Bank of Canada's conditional commitment likely has produced a  persistent effect in lowering Canadian interest rates relative to what their  historical relationship with inflation and unemployment rates would imply.  However, this finding is not statistically strong and is subject to caveats such  as possible in-sample model instability and the dependence of the results on the  choice of inflation variable."
"2010-12","Nowcasting the Global Economy","September 2010","James Rossiter","FALSE","Economic models,International topics","E,E3,E37,F,F4,F47","Forecasts of global economic activity and inflation are important inputs when conducting monetary policy in small open economies such as Canada. As part of the Bank of Canada's broad agenda to augment its short-term forecasting tools, the author constructs simple mixed-frequency forecasting equations for quarterly global output, imports, and inflation using the monthly global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). When compared against two benchmark models, the results show that the PMIs are useful for forecasting developments in the global economy. As the forecasts are updated throughout the quarter with the monthly release of the PMI, forecasting performance generally improves. An analysis of the forecasts over the period of the Great Recession (in particular, 2008Q4 to 2009Q2) shows that, while models that include the ""soft"" PMI indicators did not fully capture the sharp deterioration in the global economy, they nevertheless improved the forecasts relative to the benchmark models. This finding highlights the usefulness of such indicators for short-term forecasting."
"2010-13","Liquidity, Risk, and Return: Specifying an Objective Function for the Management of Foreign Reserves","September 2010","Yuliya Romanyuk","FALSE","Foreign reserves management","G,G1,G11","An objective function is a key component of a strategic portfolio management model used to determine the optimal allocations of assets and, possibly, their associated liabilities over some investment horizon. The author discusses investment philosophies and perspectives for the management of foreign reserves, and investigates how to translate the three common policy objectives for reserves (liquidity, safety, and return) into objective functions for strategic reserves management. Stochastic programming is identified as an advantageous modelling framework to capture the objectives of foreign reserves management, and a strategic reserves management model is illustrated that trades off expected net returns with costs and liquidity issues related to a potential liquidation of a portion of the portfolio."
"2010-14","Losses from Simulated Defaults in Canada's Large Value Transfer System","October 2010","Nellie Zhang,Tom Hossfeld","FALSE,TRUE","Financial Institutions,Financial stability,Payment clearing and settlement systems","E,E4,E47,G,G2,G21","The Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) loss-sharing mechanism was designed to  ensure that, in the event of a one-participant default, the collateral pledged  by direct members of the system would be sufficient to cover the largest  possible net debit position of a defaulting participant. However, the situation  may not hold if the indirect effects of the defaults are taken into  consideration, or if two participants default during the same payment cycle. The  authors examine surviving participant total losses under both oneand  two-participant default conditions, assuming the potential knock-on effects of  the default. Their analysis includes the impact of a decline in value of LVTS  collateral following an unexpected default."
"2010-15","Has the Inclusion of Forward-Looking Statements in Monetary Policy Communications Made the Bank of Canada More Transparent?","November 2010","Christine Fay,Toni Gravelle","TRUE,TRUE","Central bank research,Interest rates,Transmission of monetary policy","E,E5,E52,E58","To investigate the extent to which the transparency of the Bank of Canada's  monetary policy has improved, the authors examine empirically – over the period  30 October 2000 to 31 May 2007 – the reaction of Canadian financial markets to  official Bank communications, and in particular their reaction to the recent  inclusion of forward-looking policy-rate guidance in these communications. The  authors find evidence that fixed announcement date (FAD) press releases, and, to  a lesser extent, speeches by Governing Council members, significantly affect  near-term interest rate expectations, indicating that central bank communication  conveys important information to market participants. However, the authors'  results also show that FAD press releases and speeches do not significantly  impact market rates over the more recent period, when forward-looking statements  have been used on a regular basis. The authors investigate two explanations for  this change in response: (i) market participants better understand the Bank's  monetary policy reaction function as they become accustomed to the FAD regime;  or, (ii) market participants focus more on the forward-looking statements and  less on the Bank's discussion of the economic outlook, and therefore respond  less than before to new macroeconomic data releases. The authors find evidence  to support the second explanation: forward-looking statements – even though they  have been designed to be conditional – have made the Bank's decisions on the  policy rate more predictable, but not necessarily more transparent."
"2010-16","The Macroeconomic Implications of Changes in Bank Capital and Liquidity Requirements in Canada: Insights from the BoC-GEM-FIN","December 2010","Carlos De Resende,Ali Dib,Nikita Perevalov","FALSE,FALSE,FALSE","Economic models,Financial Institutions,Financial stability,International topics","E,E3,E32,E4,E44,E5,G,G1,G2","The authors use simulations within the BoC-GEM-FIN, the Bank of Canada's version  of the Global Economy Model with financial frictions in both the demand and  supply sides of the credit market, to investigate the macroeconomic implications  of changing bank regulations on the Canadian economy. Specifically, they compute  short- and long-run impacts on key macroeconomic and financial variables  following increases in the minimum required capital and liquidity ratios. The  results indicate that, while long-run effects on bank loans, lending spreads,  investment, and output are modest, the short-run effects are non-negligible. In  addition, the time horizon for implementing the regulatory changes and the  response of monetary policy substantially affect the macroeconomic outcomes.  Finally, increasing the required bank capital ratio in other economies roughly  doubles the size and duration of the economic downturn in Canada, compared to  the case where the increase is implemented only in the Canadian banking sector."

The BoC-GEM is a microfounded dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium global model with six regions, multiple sectors, and international linkages. The authors use the model to assess four main fiscal policy concerns: (i) how the effect of an isolated local fiscal stimulus differs from one jointly implemented in all regions; (ii) which regions are most likely to gain from joint fiscal stimuli, and why; (iii) how the impact of fiscal stimulus can differ conditional on how it is implemented, its timing and duration, and its magnitude relative to that of other regions; and (iv) how the impact of fiscal policy is affected by the inability of monetary policy to push nominal interest rates below zero. The authors use their results to gauge the potential effect of fiscal policy initiatives of the G-20 countries in 2009 and 2010."
"2010-2","Market Expectations and Option Prices: Evidence for the Can$/US$ Exchange Rate","March 2010","Alejandro García,Andrei Prokopiw","FALSE,FALSE","Econometric and statistical methods,Exchange rates,Financial markets","C,C0,C00,C02,G,G1,G13","Security prices contain valuable information that can be used to make a wide  variety of economic decisions. To extract this information, a model is required  that relates market prices to the desired information, and that ideally can be  implemented using timely and low-cost methods. The authors explore two models  applied to option prices to extract the risk-neutral probability density  function (R-PDF) of the expected Can$/US$ exchange rate. Each of the two models  extends the Black-Scholes model by using a mixture of two lognormals for the  terminal distribution, instead of a single lognormal: one mixed lognormal  imposes a specific stochastic process for the underlying asset, and the other  does not. The contribution of the paper is to propose a simple methodology to  build R-PDFs with a constant time to maturity in the absence of option prices  for the maturity of interest. The authors apply this methodology and find that  the two models provide similar results for the degree of uncertainty (i.e., the  variance) surrounding the future level of the exchange rate, but differ on the  likely direction of the exchange rate movements (i.e., the skewness)."
"2010-3","Le pouvoir de prévision des indices PMI","April 2010","Claudia Godbout,Jocelyn Jacob","TRUE,TRUE","Business fluctuations and cycles,International topics","E,E3,E37,F,F4,F47","The forecast of world economic growth plays a key role in the conduct of  Canadian monetary policy. In this context, the authors study the usefulness of  the monthly Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) in predicting short-term real  GDP growth in the euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and China, as well as in  the world economy. The main advantage of the PMIs lies in the timeliness of  their releases compared to that of quarterly national accounts data and other  related monthly indicators. The authors’ goal is to assess whether PMIs can help  predict real GDP growth at the margin of other traditional monthly indicators  (on top of the advantage related to their timeliness). To that end, the authors  build simple indicator models and verify whether the addition of PMIs improves  the in- and out-of-sample predictions. For all economies, PMIs turn out to be  significant explanatory variables and to substantially improve the accuracy of  predictions."
"2010-4","Prospects for Global Current Account Rebalancing","April 2010","Kimberly Beaton,Carlos De Resende,René Lalonde,Stephen Snudden","FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE","Balance of payments and components,Business fluctuations and cycles,International topics,Recent economic and financial developments","E,E2,E21,F,F0,F01,F3,F32","The authors use the Bank of Canada's version of the Global Economy Model, a  multi-country, multi-sector dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with an  active banking system (the BoC-GEM-FIN), to study the evolution of global  current account balances following the recent global financial crisis. More  specifically, they use several shocks from the model to generate a simulated  baseline scenario that mimics: (i) the initial, pre-crisis state of  disequilibrium in global current account balances, and (ii) the effects of the  crisis, including those of the policy responses undertaken worldwide. The  authors find that a sufficient set of conditions and policies for a sustainable  resolution of the global current account imbalances relies on three key  elements: (i) a continuous upward adjustment of U.S. private savings, (ii)  fiscal consolidation in advanced countries, and (iii) an orderly adjustment of  exchange rates. These three criteria facilitate a gradual decline in the U.S.  current account deficit going forward. A fourth key element, the implementation  of policies aimed at stimulating domestic demand in emerging Asia, is needed to  ensure that the counterpart of the decrease in the U.S. current account deficit  is mainly a reduction in the surpluses of emerging Asia. Sensitivity analysis  based on deviations from these conditions illustrates the factors behind the  main results and the costs associated with the alternative scenarios considered."
"2010-5","Relative Price Movements and Labour Productivity in Canada: A VAR Analysis","May 2010","Michael Dolega,David Dupuis,Lise Pichette","FALSE,FALSE,TRUE","Labour markets,Productivity,Recent economic and financial developments","E,E2,E23,E24,O,O4,O47","In recent years, the Canadian economy has been affected by strong movements in  relative prices brought about by the surging costs of energy and non-energy  commodities, with significant implications for the terms of trade, the exchange  rate, and the allocation of resources across Canadian sectors and regions. While  the energy and mining industries have benefited from these movements, the  pressure on the manufacturing sector has intensified, since many firms in this  sector were already dealing with growing competition from low-cost economies  such as China. The adjustments undertaken within the Canadian economy are  readily noticeable through investment decisions, as well as through production  and employment reallocation. Using vector autoregressive techniques, the authors  examine how an appreciation in commodity prices and the subsequent reallocation  of resources across sectors will affect hours worked and output growth and,  ultimately, aggregate and sectoral labour productivity growth in Canada. Results  suggest that the impact of a positive relative price shock will – in the  adjustment process – lower productivity growth in the primary and the  non-tradable sectors, and increase it somewhat in the manufacturing sector. The  overall impact appears to be slightly negative on aggregate labour productivity  growth, but this effect is only temporary."
"2010-6","The Fisher BCPI: The Bank of Canada’s New Commodity Price Index","May 2010","Ilan Kolet,Ryan Macdonald","FALSE,FALSE","Econometric and statistical methods,Inflation and prices","C,C1,E,E3","The prices of commodities produced in Canada have important implications for the  performance of the Canadian economy and the conduct of monetary policy. The  authors explain an important change to the methodology used to construct the  Bank of Canada commodity price index (BCPI). Since its inception, the BCPI has  been a fixed-weight index of commodity prices, with weights that were updated  roughly once a decade. Such indexes are subject to bias, because output shares  change over time. In this paper, the authors use the chain Fisher index method  to update the production weights on an annual basis, and expand the BCPI to  include a broader set of commodities. They find that the new index, called the  Fisher BCPI, is more comprehensive, flexible, and accurate than the fixed-weight  index."
"2010-7","Statistical Confidence Intervals for the Bank of Canada's Business Outlook Survey","May 2010","Daniel de Munnik","TRUE","Business fluctuations and cycles,Central bank research,Regional economic developments","C,C4,C46,C8,C81","While a number of central banks publish their own business conditions indicators  that rely on non-random sampling, knowledge about their statistical accuracy has  been limited. Recently, de Munnik, Dupuis, and Illing (2009) made some progress  in this area for the Bank of Canada's Business Outlook Survey (BOS) by  estimating the impact of the Bank's non-random sampling on the accuracy of the  survey results. They found no evidence that the Bank's firm-selection process  results in significantly biased estimates and/or wider confidence intervals than  in the random-selection case. The author deepens and extends this work by (i)  outlining the statistical properties of population-proportion and  balance-of-opinion questions, and demonstrating how their design affects the  calculation of the confidence intervals; (ii) examining the variation in  statistical confidence associated with changes in the underlying response  distribution using actual quarterly BOS results; (iii) considering the  possibility that statistical accuracy varies across questions; and (iv)  investigating whether the statistical accuracy of the survey results changes  with variations in the business cycle. The main findings are that confidence  intervals around the population-proportion questions are about half of those for  the balance-of-opinion questions, and that the confidence bands around both  types of question can change from survey to survey when the underlying response  distribution becomes more or less concentrated in particular response categories  (such as “higher,” “the same,” or “lower”). The author finds that confidence  intervals around the BOS population-proportion questions become somewhat  narrower during periods of recession, while those for the balance-of-opinion  questions vary within a similar range across the cycle."
"2010-9","Inventories in ToTEM","August 2010","Oleksiy Kryvtsov,Yang Zhang","TRUE,FALSE","Business fluctuations and cycles,Economic models","E,E3,E31,E32","ToTEM – the Bank of Canada’s principal projection and policy-analysis model for the Canadian economy – is extended to include inventories. In the model, firms accumulate inventories of finished goods for their role in facilitating the demand for goods. The model is successful in matching procyclical and volatile inventory investment behaviour. The authors show that the convex cost of stock adjustment is key to the model’s ability to match the inventory data quantitatively."
"2011-10","Financial Frictions, Financial Shocks and Labour Market Fluctuations in Canada","December 2011","Yahong Zhang","FALSE","Economic models,Financial markets,Labour markets","E,E3,E32,E4,E44,J,J6","What are the effects of financial market imperfections on unemployment and vacancies in Canada? The author estimates the model of Zhang (2011) – a standard monetary dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model augmented with explicit financial and labour market frictions – with Canadian data for the period 1984Q2–2010Q4, and uses it to examine the importance of financial shocks on labour market fluctuations in Canada. She finds that the estimated value of the elasticity of external finance, the key parameter capturing financial frictions, is much higher than the value suggested in the literature.  This gives rise to a larger amplification effect from the financial accelerator mechanism, which helps the model generate a more volatile labour market. The author finds that the model accounts well for the cyclical behaviour of unemployment and vacancies observed in the data. She also finds that financial shocks are one of the main sources of fluctuations in the Canadian labour market. Overall, financial shocks contribute about 30 per cent of the fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies for the Canadian economy."
"2011-11","A Model of the EFA Liabilities","December 2011","Francisco Rivadeneyra,Oumar Dissou","TRUE,FALSE","Debt Management,Foreign reserves management","G,G1,G12,G3,G32","The authors describe the liabilities model of the Exchange Fund Account (EFA). The EFA is managed using an asset-liability matching framework that requires currency and duration matching of both sides of the balance sheet. The model chooses the mix of liabilities across instruments and tenors that maximizes the return of the fund subject to a fixed asset-allocation rule and duration matching. The model considers two types of instruments: cross-currency swaps and global bonds. The main trade-off in the model is the cost advantage of cross-currency swaps relative to global bond issuance. Cross-currency swaps are, on average, a cheaper source of funding, but carry counterparty risk.  The model penalizes a skewed maturity profile of liabilities because it carries rollover risks. The model also reports the implied asset-liability gap, which is a function of the total amount of cross-currency swaps."
"2011-1","Financial Spillovers Across Countries: The Case of Canada and the United States","January 2011","Kimberly Beaton,Brigitte Desroches","FALSE,TRUE","Business fluctuations and cycles,Economic models,Financial stability,International topics","E,E2,E27,E3,E32,F,F3,F36,F4,F40","The authors investigate financial spillovers across countries with an emphasis  on the effect of shocks to financial conditions in the United States on  financial conditions and economic activity in Canada. These questions are  addressed within a global vector autoregression model. The framework links  individual country vector autoregression models in which the domestic variables  are related to the country-specific foreign variables. The authors' results  highlight the importance of financial variables in the transmission of shocks to  real activity and financial conditions in the United States to Canada. First,  they show that shocks to U.S. output are transmitted quickly to Canada, with  important implications for financial conditions. Second, they show that the most  important source of financial transmission between the United States and Canada  is through shocks to U.S. equity prices. Financial transmission through  movements in the quantity of U.S. credit is also important for Canada."
"2011-2","The Behaviour of Consumer Prices Across Provinces","May 2011","Gordon Wilkinson","FALSE","Inflation and prices","E,E3,E31","Measures of core inflation enable a central bank to distinguish price movements that are transitory and generated by non-monetary events from those that are more permanent and related to prior monetary policy decisions. The author uses standard statistical measures to assess the behaviour of consumer prices across provinces and identify price components with more divergent price patterns. The results indicate that energy, shelter and tobacco prices are the most volatile across provinces. Very large price movements restricted to one or a few provinces suggest that the forces or events triggering those movements may be province specific and unrelated to national demand pressures. Such results suggest that constructing a type of core inflation measure called the “trimmed mean” that excludes components with exceptionally large price changes at the provincial level may offer an alternative means of assessing underlying inflationary pressures."

The Bank of Canada provides debt-management analysis and advice to the  Government of Canada to assist in this task, with the Canadian debt-strategy  model being developed to help in this regard. The authors outline the main  elements of the model, which include: cost and risk measures, inflation-linked  debt, optimization techniques, the framework used to model the government's  funding requirement, the sensitivity of results to the choice of joint  stochastic macroeconomic term-structure model, the effects of shocks to  macroeconomic and term-structure variables and changes to their long-term  values, and the relationship between issuance yield and issuance amount.  Emphasis is placed on the degree to which changes to the formulation of model  elements impact key results. The model is an important part of the  decision-making process for the determination of the government's debt strategy.  However, it remains one of many tools that are available to debt managers and is  to be used in conjunction with the judgment of an experienced debt manager."

However, internationally accepted standards and the academic literature have left unanswered many practical questions related to the design of CCPs. The author analyzes the inherent trade‐offs and resulting international benchmarks for a certain set of issues. Four CCPs – FINet, CME Clearing, Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet – are considered in terms of risk management, CCP links, governance and operational risk."
"2011-5","External Stability, Real Exchange Rate Adjustment and the Exchange Rate Regime in Emerging-Market Economies","June 2011","Olivier Gervais,Lawrence Schembri,Lena Suchanek","TRUE,TRUE,TRUE","Development economics,Exchange rate regimes,International topics","F,F3,F31,F32,F4,F41","In emerging-market economies, real exchange rate adjustment is critical for maintaining a sustainable current account position and thereby for helping to reduce macroeconomic and financial instability. The authors examine empirically two related hypotheses: (i) that real exchange rate flexibility and adjustment promotes external stability, and (ii) that a flexible nominal exchange rate facilitates real exchange rate adjustment. Based on an  event-study analysis for a large set of emerging-market economies over the period 1975–2008, the authors find that real exchange rate adjustment has contributed significantly to reducing current account imbalances. The adjustment of current account deficits in countries with a fixed exchange rate regime does not typically occur through the classical adjustment mechanism, but as a consequence of exchange rate crises, where the nominal exchange rate collapses and there are substantial costs in terms of forgone output. Vector-error-correction results support the findings of the event study; namely, in the long run the real exchange rate movements facilitate current account adjustment."
"2011-6","The Role of Financial Speculation in Driving the Price of Crude Oil","July 2011","Ron Alquist,Olivier Gervais","FALSE,TRUE","International topics","G,G1,G12,Q,Q4,Q41","Over the past 10 years, financial firms have increased the size of their positions in the oil futures market. At the same time, oil prices have increased dramatically. The conjunction of these developments has led some observers to argue that financial speculation caused the run-up in oil prices. Yet several arguments cast doubt on the validity of this claim. First, although the stock of open futures contracts is many times larger than the flow of oil consumption in the United States, comparing these two statistics is misleading. Stocks are not measured with respect to a specific unit of time but flows are, so the two are not directly comparable. Second, empirical analysis shows that changes in financial firms’ positions do not predict oil-price changes, but that oil-price changes predict changes in positions. Third, the evidence indicates that financial firms’ positions did not cause the market to expect persistent price increases during 2007/08. Other explanations for the increase in oil prices include macroeconomic fundamentals, such as interest rates and increased demand from emerging Asia. Of these two explanations, the one that seems most consistent with the facts explains oil-price fluctuations in terms of large and persistent demand shocks related to growth in global real activity in the presence of supply constraints."
"2011-7","The Impact of Operational Events on the Network Structure of the LVTS","August 2011","Tom Roberts","TRUE","Payment clearing and settlement systems","C,C4,C49,G,G1,G14,G2,G21","The author uses a quantitative network analysis approach to assess how participants in the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) respond to partial outages at other banks. Despite the limited number of operational events, benchmarks can be established. For example, the effect of a partial outage at a big six bank that has a net payment balance of $1 billion is estimated to correspond to a decline in connectivity of about 6 or 7 per cent, due to other participants not sending payments to the problem participant. This suggests that participants tend to perceive a partial outage at a counterparty as inconvenient enough to warrant a delaying of payments, at least to the problem participant. There is no strong evidence of systemic effects, whereby participants also delay payments to non-problem counterparties, in an effort to maintain a reasonable liquidity position. Notable events mostly occurred in 2004 or 2005, and the incidence of operational events did not increase over the sample period. The improvement of contingency measures, such as the use of the LVTS Direct Network, possibly contributed in this regard."
"2011-8","Exchange Rates and Individual Good’s Price Misalignment: Some Preliminary Evidence of Long-Horizon Predictability","October 2011","Wei Dong,Deokwoo Nam","TRUE,FALSE","Exchange rates,International topics","F,F3,F31,F4,F47","When prices are sticky, movements in the nominal exchange rate have a direct impact on international relative prices. A relative price misalignment would trigger an adjustment in consumption and employment, and may help to predict future movements in the exchange rate. Although purchasing-power-parity fundamentals, in general, have only weak predictability, currency misalignment may be indicated by price differentials for some goods, which could then have predictive power for subsequent re-evaluation of the nominal exchange rate. The authors collect good-level price data to construct deviations from the law of one price and examine the resulting price-misalignment model’s predictive power for the nominal exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and two other currencies: the Japanese yen and the U.K. pound. To account for small-sample bias and data-mining issues, inference is drawn from bootstrap distributions and tests of superior predictive ability (SPA) are performed. The slope coefficients and R-squares increase with the forecast horizon for the bilateral exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar and the U.K. pound. The out-of-sample SPA tests suggest that the authors’ price-misalignment model outperforms random walks either with or without drift for the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the Japanese yen at the 5 per cent level of significance over long horizons."
"2011-9","What Matters in Determining Capital Surcharges for Systemically Important Financial Institutions?","November 2011","Céline Gauthier,Toni Gravelle,Xuezhi Liu,Moez Souissi","FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE","Financial system regulation and policies","C,C1,C15,C8,C81,E,E4,E44,G,G0,G01,G2,G21","One way of internalizing the externalities that each individual bank imposes on the rest of the financial system is to impose capital surcharges on them in line with their systemic importance. Given the complexity of the financial system and the resulting difficulties in measuring systemic importance, it is sometimes argued that higher capital surcharges should be applied to larger banks, abstracting from other factors like interconnectedness.  In this paper, the authors consider different network structures of the banking system that are characterized by two different centrality measures. Their main finding is that size alone is not always a good proxy for systemic importance: it must be supplemented with detailed information on interbank exposures. A relatively small bank playing an outsized role in the interbank market might be more systemic, and thus garner a higher capital surcharge, than a less-connected bank of somewhat larger size. Alternatively, if the centrality of banks in an interbank network is positively correlated with their size, then proxies of a bank’s systemic importance largely based on size are sufficient indicators."
"2012-1","A Foreign Activity Measure for Predicting Canadian Exports","February 2012","Louis Morel","TRUE","Balance of payments and components,Exchange rates,Recent economic and financial developments","E,E0,E00,F,F1,F17","The author constructs a measure of foreign activity that takes into account the composition of foreign demand for Canadian exports. It has a number of interesting features. First, the foreign activity measure captures both the composition of demand in the United States (by including components of U.S. private final domestic demand) and economic activity outside of the United States. Second, its coefficients have been estimated over the sample period 1981–2009 controlling for the effect of changes in relative prices. Third, compared with the Bank’s previous U.S. activity index (introduced in the July 2009 Monetary Policy Report), the foreign activity measure provides some improvements for forecasting Canadian exports, especially at longer horizons. For instance, at eight quarters ahead, the gain in terms of forecast accuracy is as much as 22 per cent. Finally, the foreign activity measure helps to explain why Canadian exports dropped by 20 per cent during the global recession of 2008–09 and have only partially recovered since that time."

In addition, about 3,500 participants completed a 3-day diary recording information on each transaction, including the value and the payment instrument chosen. One of the main findings from the diaries is that, even though debit and credit cards account for close to 80 per cent of all transactions in terms of total value, cash is still the predominant payment method in terms of volume, accounting for 54 per cent of all transactions.

Without the CCP, there exist multiple equilibria in the model. In one of the equilibria, a repo market emerges as bond dealers and cash investors choose to arrange repos in an over-the-counter bond market. In another equilibrium, the repo market collapses due to aggregate cash shortage for dealers. Introducing a CCP into the repo market blocks the latter equilibrium. This stabilizing effect of a CCP is robust to idiosyncratic default risk of dealers and asymmetric information about the risk."

They find that in Canada, most of the risks indicated by these balance‐sheet ratios are concentrated among large banks that are more likely able to withstand shocks due to their diversified portfolios. Some smaller banks, however, reveal vulnerability against liquidity risks. Regarding a Canada - U.S. comparison, small U.S. banks show more vulnerability than their larger counterparts, as well as an increasing trend in vulnerability prior to the crisis. In contrast, the ratios for small Canadian banks show increasing resilience."

These consultations, summarized in the Business Outlook Survey (BOS), are structured around a survey questionnaire that covers topics of importance to the Bank, notably business activity, pressures on production capacity, prices and inflation, and credit conditions. The author aims to enhance our understanding of the survey’s information content by extending the early work of Martin and Papile (2004) in two key ways. First, since all BOS questions are designed to capture some aspect of economic activity and are therefore interrelated, various approaches were considered to extract the common underlying variations among the indicators: a subjective approach (a simple average), principal-component analysis and factor analysis. Second, the information content of these common movements is assessed, using regression analysis and a forecasting assessment. The results suggest that all approaches to extract the information from the BOS provide very similar measures of underlying common variations. This underlying variable appears to be a useful indicator of economic activity, particularly for providing information on investment spending. However, the balance of opinion on future sales growth remains a better indicator than any measures of common movements for the growth of real GDP."

The authors find that, on average (over the 2000–07 period), about 23 per cent of households in Canada were constrained. Their results suggest that young households with fewer liquid assets, higher education and lower home equity, as well as those that are unmarried, are more likely to be liquidity constrained than other households.

Results indicate that wage adjustments for the Canadian non-union private workforce are overwhelmingly time dependent, with a fixed duration of one year, and are clustered in the first four months of the year, suggesting that wage stickiness may not be constant over the year. Ad hoc adjustments between these fixed dates are rare, but when they do occur they are almost always upward and often in response to tight labour markets. The market wage rate is the most important factor managers consider when setting wages for their employees. Depending on firm size, different strategies are used to gain information about the market wage. Other important factors taken into account when setting wages include the firm’s profitability, its difficulty in attracting staff and workers’ productivity. While many managers acknowledge a link between the wage decision and inflation, very few use formal wage indexation rules such as a cost-of-living adjustment. Rather, most describe an informal backward-looking link. Survey results also suggest that managers are very reluctant to cut nominal base wages in times of weak demand. Managers are more likely to cut incentive pay, which would allow some flexibility in total compensation even if base pay is inflexible, or reduce the quantity of labour inputs (hours and employees)."

Efforts to buttress risk management were favourably influenced by several stressful yet instructive episodes in Canadian financial history. The 2007-09 crisis experience suggests a need to make risk management a pervasive element of financial system culture and emphasizes the importance of robust liquidity management."

In line with previous Bank studies, the results suggest that the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is among the best-performing indicators to forecast real GDP growth in the euro area, while consumption indicators and business surveys (the PMI and the Economy Watchers Survey) have the most predictive power for Japan. Moreover, the results indicate that combining the predictions from a number of indicators improves forecast accuracy and can be an effective way to mitigate the volatility associated with monthly indicators.

In August 2012, the Canadian Payments Association amended the ACSS by-law and rules to repeal the unwinding provisions from the ACSS default framework. Without unwinding, payment items are no longer returned by the defaulter to the other participants as a means of reducing the defaulter’s final obligation. Instead, the other Direct Clearers (survivors) pay only additional settlement obligations to cover the defaulter’s shortfall. To assess the potential exposures of an ACSS default without unwinding, we use simulations to estimate the value of additional settlement obligations for each survivor and compare these exposures to their capital and liquid assets. Results indicate that these exposures are indeed manageable by survivors and, therefore, that the ACSS does not pose systemic risk."

We define the neutral rate as the real policy rate consistent with output at its potential level and inflation equal to target after the effects of all cyclical shocks have dissipated. This is a medium- to longer-run concept of the neutral rate. Under this definition, the neutral rate in Canada is determined by the longer-run forces that influence savings and investment in both the Canadian and global economies. Structural forces have likely reduced the neutral rate by more than a percentage point since the mid-2000s. The Bank’s estimates of the real neutral policy rate currently stand in the 1 to 2 per cent range, or 3 to 4 per cent in nominal terms. The current gap between the policy rate and the neutral rate reflects policy stimulus in response to significant excess supply and in the face of continuing headwinds. As long as these headwinds persist, a policy rate below neutral will be required to maintain inflation sustainably at target."

The sort of post-crisis uncertainty that central banks are dealing with today is more profound than that which is typically subjected to rigorous analysis and does not lend itself easily to formal modelling. As a practical matter, the policy-maker is dependent on macro models to develop a coherent monetary policy plan, and this burden of coherence means that fundamental uncertainty must be incorporated explicitly into the policy formulation process. As suggested here, doing so transforms policy formulation from an exercise in reverse engineering to one of risk management, one consequence of which is to inject a little more realism about uncertainty into the policy narrative, while trusting markets to wrestle with the data flow and deliver two-way trading. The evolution is likely to be a long one - researchers are encouraged to keep focusing on developing a practical understanding of how the economy works, one that admits that rules around economic behaviour are not cast in stone, but are almost certainly subject to variation through time and events."

At the same time, although foreign demand has accelerated following the Great Recession, Canadian exports have failed to rebound as strongly as historical correlation would suggest. If part of Canadian firms’ investment abroad over the past decade was intended to replace their Canadian production and exports, it could help to explain recent export weakness. This paper investigates these issues in the Canadian forest products industry and the motor vehicle parts manufacturing industry, using a case study approach. Specifically, we examine 15 large, Canadian, publicly traded firms, dominant in each of these industries, over the period 2000-13. We triangulate (i) financial statement data and (ii) public statements about decisions to invest abroad with (iii) macroeconomic data on the activity of Canadian foreign affiliates, focusing on investments in the United States and Mexico. We find that over this period, the companies in the study increasingly chose to invest abroad, leading to a shift in relative operational capacity from Canada to locations abroad. Motives behind this trend include market-seeking objectives, as well as relative cost factors and strategic asset seeking abroad. This shift in the location of production capacity may, at least for the industries and the time period studied, help to explain the weakness in Canadian merchandise exports over the past years, since these firms increasingly choose to serve foreign demand through their operations abroad, rather than exclusively through exports."

Since that time, NEX growth has picked up: about 80 per cent of the 31 categories have grown in line with, or outperformed, their respective U.S. benchmarks. Furthermore, about half are currently showing upward momentum. Many export categories highly sensitive to the exchange rate have been a key source of strength, as they benefited from the further depreciation of the Canadian dollar. In addition, a more granular analysis finds that export product categories are emerging or re-emerging from low levels.

Traditional exclusion-based measures of core inflation are found to perform relatively poorly across a range of evaluation criteria, in part due to their inability to filter unanticipated transitory shocks. In contrast, measures such as the trimmed mean and the common component of CPI perform favorably, since they better capture persistent price movements and tend to move with macroeconomic drivers. All measures of core inflation, however, have limitations – consequently, there is merit in monitoring a set of measures. Moreover, core inflation measures are best viewed as complements to, rather than substitutes for, the thorough analysis of inflation and capacity pressures that informs the monetary policy process."

However, the measurement and interpretation of potential output, and hence the output gap, is fraught with uncertainty, since it is unobservable. It is therefore important that we continually expand and improve upon existing models, and innovate by testing new approaches and incorporating them into the analysis of potential output and the output gap. Within this context, this paper first provides an assessment of the extended multivariate filter (EMVF), which the Bank has used since the late 1990s to come up with a baseline measure of the output gap. It is determined that the EMVF has several limitations that need to be addressed. Consequently, a modified version of the EMVF incorporating revised conditioning information is presented. In addition, a newly developed methodology, the integrated framework (IF), provides a separate analysis of trend labour input and trend labour productivity, and in doing so accounts for more long-term structural changes in the economy. While neither of these approaches is perfect, and both have limitations, they represent improvements over the conventional method. The paper also outlines how the modified EMVF, the IF, and information from the Bank’s Business Outlook Survey and other sources are used to come up with an estimate of the current output gap and the future growth rate of potential output."

The main population age groups examined are youth (aged 15-24), prime age (25-54) and older (55 and above). Six main findings are reported. First, aging has been the most important driver of reduced participation. On their own, aging effects would have depressed participation rates by more than they fell between 2007 and 2014, and have been partly offset by rising participation rates of older workers. Second, shifting age composition has had the largest impact on the Atlantic provinces, owing primarily to their shrinking prime-age populations as some workers have migrated west. Third, a considerable part of the overall participation rate decline since 2007 reflects a greater share of prime-age and youth populations that are out of the labour force for various reasons including school, illness, and family responsibilities. These changes appear to be driven by both structural and cyclical forces, although the relative importance of each is unclear. Fourth, effects associated with “discouraged workers” have been negligible. Fifth, youth participation rates have fallen the most, by 2.8 percentage points since 2007, with 9 per cent of the decline reflecting purely higher school enrolment rates. Sixth, weak business conditions appear to be the main driver behind the shift toward part-time employment since the Great Recession, with involuntary part-time work explaining almost the entire increase since 2007."

In this paper, export-demand equations for a panel of 18 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are estimated in order to assess whether this sluggishness can be attributed to weak foreign demand. Over half of the slowdown in advanced-economy export growth since 2011 (relative to the pre-crisis trend) can be explained by weak global demand growth. More specifically, exports in advanced economies have been restrained by the weakness of global investment, a trade-intensive demand component and weak demand out of Europe, a region that accounts for about 40 per cent of the demand for advanced-economy exports. Weak foreign demand cannot explain all of the weakness in aggregate OECD exports since 2011, suggesting that other factors have also played a role."

In this paper, we analyze market shares for four main trading partners of the United States (Canada, Mexico, China and Japan). We use shift-share analysis to decompose movements in the aggregate market shares into those related to actual shifts in product-specific market shares, versus shifts in the composition of U.S. import demand and the interaction between these two effects. Our analysis shows that separating these effects is important, since shifts in product-specific market shares explain varying amounts of movements in the overall market shares across countries and between time periods. Specifically, we find that two-thirds of Canada’s decline in U.S. market share is due to shifts in product-specific market shares and that these losses were relatively stable across subperiods. In contrast, losses associated with a shift in the composition of U.S. import demand were most important during the crisis and have in fact supported Canada’s market share since 2009. We also find that almost three-quarters of Canada’s total loss in market share was concentrated in two sectors: (i) motor vehicles and parts, and (ii) forestry products and building and packaging materials. Japan’s loss in U.S. market share was very similar to Canada’s over this period. In contrast, China and Mexico both gained market share between 2002 and 2014. China gained mostly in product-specific market share, while Mexico benefited from favourable shifts in U.S. import demand."

Second, it develops a taxonomy for clearly describing the defining attributes of a payment system. These defining attributes are access, functionality, interoperability, timeliness of payments and risk management. Finally, we develop an analytic framework to consider the trade-offs of the various attributes to achieve the PPOs for the Canadian payments ecosystem.

This paper reviews four considerations of interest, taking stock of key domestic and international developments and knowledge gained over the past few years: (i) Canada and other countries have made significant progress in the implementation of micro- and macroprudential regulatory reforms, and limited existing research finds that most of these policies were effective in reducing the potential need for leaning by monetary policy; (ii) the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism depends on the state of the financial system, implying that financial system conditions need to be taken into account by monetary policy; (iii) although exceptionally low interest rates and other forms of monetary stimulus are sometimes needed to support growth and achieve inflation-target mandates, they may lead to excessive risk-taking activities and therefore contribute to the buildup of financial imbalances; and (iv) coordination of monetary and macroprudential policies for dealing with imbalances may, in some circumstances, be beneficial. The paper concludes by identifying future areas of research to further clarify the role of monetary policy in addressing financial stability risks."

Despite the deployment of unconventional monetary policy measures by many central banks, the ZLB has proven to be a more severe and persistent obstacle to the achievement of policy goals than expected. At the same time, analysis by the Bank and others has found that interest rates are likely to be lower on average in the future than they were during the first two decades of inflation targeting. As a consequence, the probability of being constrained by the ZLB is likely higher. Together, these factors suggest that a target above 2 per cent should be considered. This paper provides an overview of the current state of knowledge and key outstanding issues regarding the costs and benefits of a higher inflation target."

Many observers have raised concerns that with the reduction in the neutral rate, and the experience of the recent financial crisis, the effective lower bound (ELB) is more likely to be binding in the future if inflation targets remain at 2 per cent. This has led some to argue that the inflation target should be raised to reduce the incidence of ELB episodes. Much of this debate has assumed that the ELB is close to, but not below, zero. Recently, however, a number of central banks have introduced negative policy interest rates. This paper outlines the concerns associated with negative interest rates, provides an overview of the international experience so far with negative policy rates and sets out some general observations based on this experience. It then discusses how low policy interest rates might be able to go in these economies, and offers some considerations for the renewal of the inflation-control agreement."

A large body of evidence suggests that expanding the central bank’s balance sheet through large-scale asset purchases can provide effective stimulus under the ELB. Transmission channels for QE are broadly similar to those of conventional policy, notwithstanding some important but subtle differences. The effectiveness of QE may be affected by imperfect pass-through to asset prices, possible leakage through global capital reallocation, a reduced impact through the bank lending channel, and diminishing returns to additional rounds of QE. Although the benefits of QE appear, so far, to outweigh the costs, at some point this may be reversed. The exact “effective quantitative bound” where the costs of QE become larger than the benefits is as yet unknown. The summary of the evidence, however, suggests that QE is indeed an “adequate” substitute for monetary policy at the ELB, rather than a “perfect” one."

It became more widely used during and after the global financial crisis. This paper reviews the international experience, based on the six central banks that have used forward guidance when operating at the ELB, in order to assess its effectiveness and the potential risks associated with its implementation. We distinguish between three distinct types of forward guidance (qualitative, time contingent and state contingent) and discuss the channels through which forward guidance operates. Overall, we find that forward guidance can be an effective tool at the ELB when clearly communicated and perceived as credible. Though evidence from the literature is somewhat mixed—since the specific effects vary across economies, episodes and type of guidance—it has generally been found to be effective in (1) lowering expectations of the future path of policy rates, (2) improving the predictability of short-term yields over the near term and (3) changing the sensitivity of financial variables to economic news. However, as with other monetary policy tools, the benefits of forward guidance need to be weighed against the costs. Those costs are mainly associated with potential loss of credibility and increased financial stability risks. Moreover, the international experience with forward guidance under conditions of negative ELBs and interest rates is limited to date."

However, evidence of their effectiveness in providing countercyclical stabilization by curbing credit growth (“leaning against the financial cycle”) is limited. Among the different types of macroprudential measures, those that are “sectoral” in nature and/or those that target borrowers are most effective in leaning against the financial cycle. Overall, the observed effectiveness of macroprudential tools in addressing systemic risk implies that these policies can be complementary to monetary policy in achieving the goals of macroeconomic and financial stability."

It finds that, to date, there is evidence that the G20’s reform measures are increasing financial system resilience globally, especially in the banking sector. Yet, implementation is still ongoing, and it may be too early to judge how the reform measures are interacting with one another. In Canada, the resilience of the financial system is being enhanced by the ongoing implementation of more-rigorous global regulatory and supervisory standards. Consequently, the likelihood and impact of severe financial stress in the future should be reduced, supporting the primary focus of monetary policy on achieving its 2 per cent inflation target."

The paper finds that there is an intimate relationship between the monetary/fiscal policy mix and the dynamics of both private sector and public sector debt accumulation. No attempt is made to develop criteria for policy mix optimization, since it is clear from the model simulations that the appropriate policy mix is highly state-dependent. This finding points to the need for a coherent framework for weighing the relative financial and macroeconomic consequences of accumulating public sector versus private sector debt.

At a high level, we find that most jurisdictions have added a new real-time retail system, all have a batch retail payment system, and the vast majority have made upgrades to their large-value payment systems. Second, we evaluate what core system upgrades have resulted in improved access, functionality, interoperability, timeliness and risk management. Finally, we analyze the overarching design found in multiple core payment systems across jurisdictions and identify four distinct core payment system configurations. These main core system configurations reflect the different approaches taken to modernize, depending on jurisdictional factors, including public policy objectives, drivers, needs, payment instruments and gaps resulting from legacy systems. We conclude that it is necessary to have a complete understanding of modernization objectives, based on each country’s unique jurisdictional factors. A comprehensive set of modernization objectives can then be used to develop a holistic multi-system plan, designed to modernize each core payment system in a complementary manner."

As part of this process, central banks became quite active in supporting financial stability in a variety of ways, such as publicly sharing their assessments of financial system vulnerabilities and risks and helping to strengthen regulation, supervision and macroprudential measures. However, the use of monetary policy instruments for managing financial stability risks is more widely debated because central banks may face a trade-off between attaining their inflation targets in a timely manner and exacerbating financial stability risks. Recent research suggests that central banks that tend to have stronger financial stability mandates and less influence over regulatory and macroprudential tools are more likely to use monetary policy to address financial stability risks."

We consider schemes that use a collateral pool calculated using a rolling time window. Our simulations show that the size of the window has a very significant effect on the average level of collateral and its variability day to day, creating an interesting trade-off. Collateral levels and variability may be important for ACSS participants because they could affect the opportunity costs of pledging collateral, and also the costs of managing it over time. Our results contribute to understanding the practical implementation of risk management schemes in the current and future generations of payment systems in Canada."

A key financial system vulnerability in Canada is elevated household indebtedness: as more and more households are nearing their debt-capacity limits, the likelihood and severity of a large negative correction in housing markets are also increasing. Adjusting the path of policy rates can be effective in reducing the buildup of household debt and the likelihood of a house price correction over the medium term. Such adjustments can also generate a fall in inflation and in output over the short term compared with the case without a policy-rate adjustment. Overall, the estimated benefits of a leaning adjustment tend to be smaller than its social losses, since its impact on the buildup of vulnerabilities is modest and the reduction in the incidence of house price corrections or financial crises is limited."

To facilitate adoption of this approach, we allow loss sharing to be capped through the allocation of bilateral credit limits. We undertake an empirical exercise to demonstrate that, even with conservative assumptions, the proposed approach can generate significant margin relief without generating losses that cannot be absorbed by clearing members."

Our search for a suitable structural model revealed that the Bank of Canada version of the global economy model (BoC-GEM-FIN) comes closest to our needs. BoC-GEM-FIN includes region-specific interbank markets, as well as some international borrowing and lending, but abstracts from the international interbank lending. This paper describes the modifications we made in order to introduce the international interbank market into BoC-GEM-FIN. The modified model is calibrated to match the changes in international interbank lending positions and the decline in the business lending of US banks that took place after the fourth quarter of 2008. Our simulations show that the international interbank market amplifies spillover effects of demand shocks but does not systematically alter the effects of supply shocks, including those for commodities."

This paper asks whether the Bank of Canada’s current effective exchange rate measure, the CERI, is still an accurate measure of Canada’s international competitiveness. Overall, while the CERI represented an improvement over previous measures when it was introduced, we find that it has several drawbacks that make it less well suited to address current competitiveness issues. To address these deficiencies, we develop a new Canadian effective exchange rate (CEER) index using a methodology based on current international best practices. The new index includes a broader set of countries and uses annually updated competition-based weights. These weights account for both Canada’s bilateral trade with another country and the competition Canada faces from that country on a product-by-product basis in third markets. We find that the CEER has depreciated less than the CERI in recent years, reflecting the greater importance of third-market competition from emerging-market economies in the CEER. This could help explain why Canada’s share of the U.S. import market has continued to decline despite the recent large depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the currencies of a number of advanced economies."

Recent values for the LMI show that labour markets have deteriorated notably in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

In British Columbia, all new homes must be registered with the Homeowner Protection Office, a branch of BC Housing, before the issuance of building permits and the start of construction. Data on new housing registrations (NHR) could thus potentially be used as an even earlier leading indicator of economic activity. This study assesses whether NHR data have significant predictive power for economic activity in British Columbia. The authors find that quarterly increases in new registrations for single detached homes have statistically significant predictive content for growth in real GDP over the next one to three quarters, and provide stronger signals compared to housing starts and building permits over this forecast horizon. These signals remain significant for growth in real GDP over the next two quarters even in the presence of other leading indicators in the equations. However, forecasts using quarterly NHR data with other leading indicators are not able to outperform simple benchmark forecasts in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise. Nonetheless, adding the NHR variable to an AR(1) equation does produce forecasts that are superior to a simple AR(1) and that at one quarter ahead also outperform an AR(1) augmented with building permits."

The effect is particularly pronounced for pairs involving the Swiss franc. These deviations are distinct from those observed during the financial crisis. We argue that they are a consequence of reduced liquidity in foreign exchange markets, rather than imbalances in international funding markets. A reduction in the supply of forward contracts, owing to limited dealer capacity following the SNB decision, led to wide bid-ask spreads in the forward market. This friction, pertaining specifically to the foreign exchange market rather than broader funding markets, allowed deviations from CIP to persist."

This paper contributes to the ongoing policy debate on the factors behind this weakness by analyzing the role of growth prospects and uncertainty in explaining developments in non-residential private business investment in large advanced economies since the crisis. Augmenting the traditional models of investment with measures of growth expectations for output and uncertainty about global demand improves considerably the ability to explain investment growth. Our results suggest that the main driver behind the weakness in global investment in recent years is primarily a pessimistic outlook on the part of firms regarding the strength of future demand. Lower levels of uncertainty have supported investment growth modestly over 2013–14. Similarly, diminishing credit constraints, lower borrowing costs and relatively stronger corporate profits have also supported the recovery in business investment from 2010 onward. Our findings have two important implications for the global outlook for investment. First, the expected improvements in global growth should support a recovery in investment; however, a slowdown in growth in emerging-market economies or further growth disappointment in advanced economies could restrain this recovery. Second, the ongoing recovery in investment remains vulnerable to uncertainty shocks."

Most notably, in December 2015, the United States approved long-delayed legislation to increase the representation of developing countries in the Fund’s governance structure. The vital progress on quota shares has finally allowed for a resumption of wider and increasingly critical discussion of the strategic role of the IMF in the post-crisis world. This paper aims to relaunch the debate by assessing the recent reforms and changes, identifying areas where progress is still needed and proposing solutions. Our findings suggest that, while much has been accomplished by the Fund’s management and staff since the global crisis, there is still a pressing need for member countries to push for further reforms if the IMF is to remain a relevant player in the rapidly evolving global economic and financial system. Emerging-market economies remain under-represented at the Fund and continue to perceive the IMF as biased against them, undermining the influence of its advice, despite the increase in their quota share and changes to improve the quality, efficiency and even-handedness of the IMF’s surveillance and lending. In advanced economies, where the Fund has traditionally had little traction on national policies, the institution faces the challenge of managing and communicating its independence in programs involving large shareholders. We propose reforms aimed at improving country representation, granting the IMF real operational independence and enhancing its catalytic role."

Since 2014, however, a substantial inventory overhang has led to a steep correction in the housing market, which in turn has contributed up to a third of the 25 per cent decline in base metal prices.

As a result of the changing regulations, bank dealers introduced various “credit” and “liquidity” charges for uncollateralized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trades, governed by a one-way or asymmetric credit support annex (CSA), whereby only bank dealers are required to post collateral in favour of official institutions—sovereigns, central banks, government agencies, sovereign wealth funds and supranational institutions—such as the Government of Canada. These charges have sharply increased costs for the government, which, like other official institutions, has been an extensive user of OTC derivatives. In this paper, we propose a framework that official institutions can use to analyze the cost and risk trade-offs among potential margining policies, including moving to a more symmetric CSA versus the prevailing one-way CSAs. Our analysis indicates that, in the case of Canada, moving to a more symmetric CSA results in lower cost and risk for the government relative to the prevailing one-way CSA margining policy, due to the government’s relatively lower funding cost. In fact, all margining policies tested dominate the prevailing one-way CSA prior to 2015. As a result, remaining under the one-way CSA and continuing to transact OTC derivatives is no longer the best policy given the charges levied against the government."

"2017-1","An Improved Equation for Predicting Canadian Non-Commodity Exports","January 2017","Patrick Alexander,Jean-Philippe Cayen,Alex Proulx","TRUE,TRUE,FALSE","Balance of payments and components,Exchange rates,International topics","F,F1,F10,F14,F17","We estimate two new equations for Canadian non-commodity exports (NCX) that incorporate three important changes relative to the current equation used at the Bank of Canada. First, we develop two new foreign activity measures (FAMs), which add new components to the FAM currently used at the Bank of Canada. The first measure adds US exports and US government expenditures, and the second adds US industrial production. These new FAMs calibrate the weights on the various components based on the 2014 World Input-Ouput Database to avoid the instability problem that arises when the equations are estimated. Second, we add a new variable to the equations, the trend of Canada’s manufacturing share of output, to control for structural or competitiveness factors that affect Canada’s global import market share. Third, the relative price of exports is determined by a new measure of the Canadian real effective exchange rate developed by Barnett, Charbonneau and Poulin-Bellisle (2016). We find that the new equations improve the in-sample fit and the out-of-sample forecast accuracy relative to the current equation specified in “LENS,” a forecasting model used at the Bank of Canada."

The apparent disconnect between exports and the Bank of Canada’s current measure of foreign demand has created an impetus to search for an alternative. Based on a dynamic factor model (DFM) methodology, we use a broad range of international economic indicators (close to 300) to estimate external demand for Canadian exports. The new measure, Global Real Activity for Canadian Exports (GRACE), follows Binette et al. (2014) who suggest that a mix of global final expenditure and production variables could help better identify activity relevant to Canadian exports. They also suggest that non?US variables might be relevant. GRACE uses final expenditure and production variables not only from the United States but also for all of Canada’s major trading partners. We apply this approach to total exports and 14 subaggregates of Canadian exports. Overall, we find that this new measure has good theoretical and empirical properties, especially for higher-level aggregates."
"2017-3","Repo Market Functioning when the Interest Rate Is Low or Negative","January 2017","Jean-Sébastien Fontaine,James Hately,Adrian Walton","TRUE,TRUE,TRUE","Financial markets,Interest rates,Market structure and pricing","D,D4,G,G1,G10,G12","This paper investigates how a low or negative overnight interest rate might affect the Canadian repo markets. The main conclusion is that the repo market for general collateral will continue to function effectively. However, changes to market conventions—such as the introduction of a charge for settlement fails—or other institutional changes may be required so that the repo market for specific collateral continues to support liquidity on the secondary market for government bonds. The historical experience shows that the special repo market in other jurisdictions can function effectively even if the overnight rate is negative. Closer examination suggests what specific circumstances can lead to persistent settlement fails in the specific collateral repo market. Specifically, the combination of (i) low or negative interest rates, (ii) large aggregate short positions in bonds, and (iii) economic or policy surprises may lead to persistent settlement fails."

For each payment method, it examines the total resource costs, which capture the overall use of resources by society as a whole. Using extensive survey data from retailers, financial institutions and cash transportation companies as well as internal and external data sources, the results show that the resource costs of payments in Canada are non-negligible (0.78 per cent of GDP). Credit cards are most costly in terms of resource costs per transaction, while cash carries the highest resource costs per dollar transacted. Debit cards are the least costly, both in terms of costs per transaction and costs per dollar in sales. The study also demonstrates how the costs vary with transaction sizes. Considering the variable resource costs only, cash is found to be cheapest for transactions up to $6, while debit cards are the least costly for transactions larger than $6. The study also looks into the total private costs, which are the costs incurred by each stakeholder, thereby providing insight into how costs are affecting the use and acceptance of payment methods."
"2017-5","Assessing the Business Outlook Survey Indicator Using Real-Time Data","April 2017","Lise Pichette,Marie-Noëlle Robitaille","TRUE,FALSE","Business fluctuations and cycles,Regional economic developments","C,C5,C53,C8,C82,E,E3,E37","Every quarter, the Bank of Canada conducts quarterly consultations with businesses across Canada, referred to as the Business Outlook Survey (BOS). A principal-component analysis conducted by Pichette and Rennison (2011) led to the development of the BOS indicator, which summarizes survey results and is used by the Bank as a gauge of overall business sentiment. In this paper, we examine whether data vintages matter when assessing the predictive content of the BOS indicator and individual BOS questions and whether the BOS is a better indicator of revised or unrevised macroeconomic data. As an indicator of business sentiment in the context of monetary policy, the reliability of the BOS is essential, and it is crucial to understand whether the signals it sends are best interpreted for early-released or revised data. For this purpose, we use different methods of forecasting that take into account the real-time perspective of the data. Results from the different methods show that the BOS content is informative regardless of data revisions. However, in real time, the BOS indicator and individual BOS questions are found to produce better nowcasts of first-released data or partially revised data than of latest-available data. This is particularly important in the case of growth in real business investment. In fact, because revisions to real business investment are more volatile than revisions to real gross domestic product (GDP), the choice of data vintages when assessing the ability of the BOS to forecast growth appears to be more important for real business investment than for real GDP."

Traditionally, foreign exchange reserve managers and other investors have relied on credit rating agencies (CRAs) as the main source for credit assessments. The Financial Stability Board issued a set of principles in support of financial stability to reduce reliance on CRA ratings in standards, laws and regulations. To support efforts to end mechanistic reliance on CRA ratings and instead establish stronger internal credit assessment practices, this paper provides a detailed technical description of a methodology developed to assign an internal credit rating to multilateral development banks (MDBs), using only publicly available data. The methodology relies on fundamental credit analysis that produces a forward-looking assessment of the investment entity’s capacity and willingness to pay its financial obligations, resulting in an opinion on the relative credit standing or likelihood of default. This methodology proposes four key innovations: (i) a simple way of estimating the capital adequacy ratio, (ii) new metrics to evaluate the liquidity and funding profile of an MDB, (iii) a straightforward approach to evaluating the exceptional support from shareholders, and (iv) a new criterion related to corporate governance, which provides a high level of objectivity in assessing some of the qualitative indicators. The methodology is a key component of the joint Bank of Canada and Department of Finance Canada initiative to develop internal credit assessment capabilities and is currently used to assess eligibility and inform investment decisions in the management of Canada’s foreign exchange reserves."

Canadian provincial GDP is released by Statistics Canada on an annual basis only, with a significant lag (11 months). This necessitates a mixed-frequency approach that can process timely monthly data, the quarterly national accounts and the annual target variable. The model is estimated on a wide set of provincial, national and international data. We assess the extent to which these indicators can be used to nowcast annual provincial GDP in a pseudo real‐time setting and construct indicators of unobserved monthly GDP for each province that can be used to assess the state of regional economies. The monthly activity indicators fit the data well in‐sample, are able to track business‐cycle turning points across the provinces, and showcase the significant regional heterogeneity that characterizes a large diverse country like Canada. They also provide more timely indications of business‐cycle turning points and are able to pick up shorter periods of economic contraction that would not be observed in the annual average. In a pseudo real‐time exercise, we find the model outperforms simple benchmarks and is competitive with more sophisticated mixedfrequency approaches such as MIDAS models."

Sutherland","TRUE","Financial markets,Interest rates,Monetary policy framework,Monetary policy implementation,Transmission of monetary policy","E,E4,E41,E43,E5,E52,E58,F,F3,F36,G,G1,G14,G15,G2,G21","The Canadian overnight repo market persistently shows signs of latent funding pressure around month-end periods. Both the overnight repo rate and Bank of Canada liquidity provision tend to rise in these windows. This paper proposes three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain this phenomenon. First, month-end funding pressure may be caused by search frictions. Market participants place a premium on liquidity around month-end periods because of the confluence of a generalized liquidity preference, heightened month-end forecast uncertainty, and resultant search frictions in the repo market. Second, this funding pressure could be attributed to spillovers from the US overnight repo market. Third, month-end funding pressure might be associated with large Canadian banks’ end-of-month repo adjustments. By combining market, central-bank and payments data, this paper provides evidence that the first hypothesis explains the latent funding pressure observed on the first day of the month. Using market and non-public regulatory data, this paper further argues that the second and third hypotheses are much less plausible."
