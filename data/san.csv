"2015-1","Foreign Flows and Their Effects on Government of Canada Yields","November 2015","Bruno Feunou|Jean-Sébastien Fontaine|James Kyeong|Jesus Sierra","International financial markets,International topics,Transmission of monetary policy","F,F3,F32","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/san2015-1-.pdf","Foreign investment flows into Government of Canada (GoC) bonds have surged since the financial crisis. Our empirical analysis suggests that foreign flows of $150 billion lowered the 10-year GoC bond yield by 100 basis points between 2009 and 2012. In addition, foreign outflows largely accounted for the 70-basis-point rise in the 10-year yield around the U.S. “taper tantrum” in mid-2013. Our analysis suggests that foreign investment flows mostly reduced bond risk premiums rather than lowering expectations of future short-term interest rates."
"2015-2","Estimating Canada’s Effective Lower Bound","December 2015","Jonathan Witmer|Jing Yang","Central bank research,Monetary policy framework,Monetary policy implementation","D,D5,D53,E,E4,E41,E43,E5,E58","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/san2015-2.pdf","In 2009, the Bank of Canada set its effective lower bound (ELB) at 25 basis points (bps). Given the recent experience of Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the euro area with negative interest rates, we examine the economics of negative interest rates and suggest that cash storage costs are the source of a negative lower bound on interest rates. European experience demonstrates that markets can adapt to challenges associated with negative interest rates. However, given uncertainty over the precise level of the lower bound, central banks should monitor both market functioning and the demand for cash in order to identify signals that policy rates are approaching their lower bound."
"2015-3","Credit Cards: Disentangling the Dual Use of Borrowing and Spending","December 2015","Olga Bilyk|Brian Peterson","Credit and credit aggregates,Financial stability","","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/san2015-3.pdf","Over the past 15 years, aggregate credit card balances have been increasing, except for a brief spell in the aftermath of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Determining whether the growing balances are due to increased usage of credit cards as a method of payment or whether they reflect increased short-term borrowing is challenging because aggregate balances are snapshots of charges on credit cards before households make their monthly payments. In this note, we exploit household-level survey data to distinguish between the dual use of credit cards for borrowing or paying for purchases.We find that the growth in credit card balances over the past 15 years reflects increased usage of credit cards for payment (i.e., spending) rather than increased short-term borrowing."

This is in contrast to the pre-crisis period, when errors were consistently positive as global GDP surprised to the upside. All major regions have contributed to the forecast errors observed since 2011, although the United States has been the most persistent source of notable errors. In turn, the Bank of Canada’s gauge of foreign demand for Canadian exports—the foreign activity measure—has been continuously revised down. Average forecast errors for Canadian GDP growth are also negative over this period, particularly at the one-year-ahead horizon. The most important contributors to this unexpected weakness are exports and business fixed investment, the effects of which were only partly offset by positive surprises on housing. We find that the one-year-ahead export errors can be linked in part to the unanticipated weakness in US growth. Canadian competitiveness may also have been weaker than assumed. The errors on business investment correlate with measures of firm sentiment and uncertainty, as well as with deviations in oil prices from the view in the Bank’s baseline forecast. The possibility that a period of negative surprises in foreign and domestic output growth could continue over the coming years raises important questions for future study by central banks and policy-makers."
"2016-11","Low for Longer? Why the Global Oil Market in 2014 Is Not Like 1986","July 2016","Bahattin Buyuksahin|Reinhard Ellwanger|Kun Mo|Konrad Zmitrowicz","International topics,Recent economic and financial developments","E,E3,Q,Q4,Q41,Q43","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san2016-11.pdf","In the second half of 2014, oil prices experienced a sharp decline, falling more than 50 per cent between June 2014 and January 2015. A cursory glance at this oil price crash suggests similarities to developments in 1986, when the price of oil declined by more than 50 per cent, initiating an episode of relatively low oil prices that lasted for more than a decade. This analytical note compares the 1986 price decline with the current episode more closely, and its key findings suggest important differences. While oil demand had been falling in the beginning of the 1980s, demand growth currently is being sustained by emerging economies and is projected to be more stable. Also, spare production capacity is significantly smaller today. Due to higher decline rates and shorter investment cycles of unconventional production, current supply is expected to adjust faster to low prices and reductions in investment spending. As long as oil demand from emerging economies remains robust, increases in production will require additional investment in high-cost production. The cost of this incremental production points to higher prices in the medium term than were observed in 2015, although the potential size of a price increase is limited because of ongoing cost-cutting initiatives and technological advances. Due to the fundamental changes in the oil market, it is unlikely that a decade of low oil prices—similar to the experience following the 1986 oil price crash—will repeat itself."

In this note, we estimate the effects through a simple econometric exercise using a vector error-correction model (VECM). Both a descriptive analysis of the raw data and an event-study analysis based on the output from the VECM suggest that while the tightening of the mortgage rules contributed to slower growth of both credit and residential investment, the effects were not always immediate. In some episodes, a tightening was followed by a temporary increase in residential mortgage credit growth (a finding that persists even after controlling for other events in the economy), possibly in anticipation of additional tightenings. In the long run, however, the residential mortgage growth rate was reduced. The consequences of rule changes were more persistent for residential mortgage growth than for the more volatile residential investment growth."
"2016-13","The Global Benefits of Low Oil Prices: More Than Meets the Eye","September 2016","Robert Fay|Justin-Damien Guénette|Louis Morel","Business fluctuations and cycles,International topics,Recent economic and financial developments","E,E3,E32,E37,F,F0,F01,Q,Q4,Q43","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/san2016-13.pdf","Between mid-2014 and early 2016, oil prices fell by roughly 65 per cent. This note documents the channels through which this oil price decline is expected to affect the global economy. One important and immediate channel is through higher expenditures, especially in net oil-importing countries. Although there is considerable uncertainty over the estimated impact, to date, these expenditures appear to have been small, because the response of investment in oil-producing countries has been negative, large and quick to materialize. This negative response has dominated the positive response of expenditures in oil-importing countries. It is also important, however, to consider how the oil price decline can improve private and public sector balance sheets, as it is expected to support private and public spending in future years. To this extent, global benefits go beyond what is captured in current GDP measures and, as such, there is more to this issue than meets the eye."
"2016-14","A Primer on Neo-Fisherian Economics","September 2016","Robert Amano|Thomas J. Carter|Rhys R. Mendes","Central bank research,Economic models,Inflation and prices,Interest rates,Monetary policy framework,Transmission of monetary policy","E,E4,E5","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/san2016-14.pdf","Conventional models imply that central banks aiming to raise inflation should lower nominal rates and thus stimulate aggregate demand. However, several economists have recently challenged this conventional wisdom in favour of an alternative “neo-Fisherian’’ view under which higher nominal rates might in fact lead to higher inflation. In this note, we show that a simple New Keynesian model can indeed deliver a neo-Fisherian link from higher nominal rates to higher inflation. However, the conditions under which this link emerges include a configuration of fiscal and monetary policy, which departs substantially from the configuration normally assumed in the New Keynesian literature. In particular, this configuration involves a commitment that the central bank will not respond too aggressively if inflation is off target, in the sense that policy will be set in a manner inconsistent with the Taylor principle. Active use of inflation to manage real government debt would also be needed. We identify significant challenges associated with both these conditions and argue that they militate against policies that aim to exploit the neo-Fisherian mechanism."
"2016-15","The Share of Systematic Variations in the Canadian Dollar—Part I","November 2016","Jean-Sébastien Fontaine|Guillaume Nolin","Exchange rates","F,F3,F31","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/san2016-15.pdf","In this analytical note we show that the share of the systematic variations in the Canadian dollar has risen significantly in the past two decades. Systematic variations in the exchange rate are shared with other currencies. This parallels the equity market, where variations in the price of a given stock are shared with variations in the prices of other stocks. In the simplest case—the capital asset pricing model—the amount of systematic variations is given by the covariance of this stock with the equity market index. In the context of currencies, exchange rate variations that are systematic originate from common international economic or financial conditions affecting all exchange rates. These systematic variations contrast with domestic changes in economic or financial conditions specific to one country and affecting only that country’s exchange rate. Separating systematic variations is useful and essential to identify the effect of domestic economic news or policy decisions on the exchange rate."
"2016-16","Comparing Forward Guidance and Neo-Fisherianism as Strategies for Escaping Liquidity Traps","December 2016","Robert Amano|Thomas J. Carter|Rhys R. Mendes","Central bank research,Economic models,Inflation and prices,Interest rates,Monetary policy framework,Transmission of monetary policy","E,E4,E5","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/san2016-16.pdf","What path should policy-makers select for the nominal rate when faced with a liquidity trap during which the effective lower bound binds? Conventional wisdom has generally favoured a commitment to keep rates low for long, namely under the guise of forward guidance policies, while Cochrane (2016) and others have recently made the case for neo-Fisherian policies that involve pegging rates at a high level in the hopes that the Fisher effect might deliver higher inflation over time. We compare these two options as strategies for escaping liquidity traps and argue that their relative merits likely depend on the mechanism that initially gave rise to the particular trap in question. More specifically, we argue that policy-makers should distinguish between “shock-based” traps that arise following large, negative demand shocks (Eggertsson and Woodford 2003) and “expectation-based” traps that arise from self-fulfilling shifts in private sector expectations (Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe 2001). This is because forward guidance likely dominates in the former case, while the latter may favour neo-Fisherianism to the extent that keeping rates low for long might reinforce the pessimistic beliefs underlying expectation-based traps. Although empirical strategies for distinguishing between these two mechanisms would be a promising topic for future research, we conclude by arguing that the shock-based mechanism likely provides a more plausible explanation for the low inflation witnessed in many developed countries during and after the Great Recession."

We quantify separately the impacts coming from the commodity sector restructuring and the broader effect of significantly lower terms of trade. Based on our analysis, the impact on the Canadian economy will occur in three phases. By the end of phase 3, in 2020, the level of Canadian GDP will be 2 per cent lower due to the commodity price decline than it otherwise would have been had commodity prices stayed at the mid-2014 level. At this point, the commodity sector is expected to play a smaller role in the Canadian economy."
"2016-2","Predictive Ability of Commodity Prices for the Canadian Dollar","March 2016","Kimberly Berg|Pierre Guérin|Yuko Imura","Econometric and statistical methods,Exchange rates","","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/san2016-2.pdf","Recent sharp declines in commodity prices and the simultaneous depreciation of the Canadian dollar (CAD) relative to the U.S. dollar (USD) have rekindled an interest in the relationship between commodity prices and the CAD-USD exchange rate. In this note, we evaluate the individual predictive ability in terms of point forecasts and directional accuracy of energy and non-energy commodity prices, the Canada-U.S. interest rate differential, and the USD multilateral factor – which captures co-movements of major currencies relative to the USD – in explaining movements in the nominal CAD-USD exchange rate at the daily, monthly and quarterly frequencies. We not only confirm that both energy and non-energy commodity prices are each individually helpful in explaining contemporaneous movements in the nominal CAD-USD exchange rate, but also find that the USD multilateral factor has a stronger predictive ability."
"2016-3","Canadian Labour Market Dispersion: Mind the (Shrinking) Gap","March 2016","David Amirault|Naveen Rai","Labour markets,Regional economic developments","J,J0,J01,R,R2,R23","http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/san2016-3.pdf","Shocks to a currency area can and often do have asymmetric impacts on its regions that, in the absence of perfect labour mobility, lead to gaps in relative labour market performance. Witness, for example, the effects of the 2008/09 recession and subsequent financial crisis in Europe on the dispersion of employment rates across the euro area – and to a lesser extent the United States. These interregional labour market gaps can persist, as has traditionally been the case for Canadian provinces. From 1976 to 1997, the mean absolute dispersion between any one province and the national employment rate was 5.5 percentage points – significantly higher than the corresponding measure in the United States. Since then, however, the Canadian metric has fallen consistently and in 2015 was not that different than its U.S. equivalent. Despite the impacts of commodity price booms from 2003 to 2008 and 2010 to 2014, the 2008 Great Recession, and the recent sharp decline in commodity prices on the Canadian economy, Canada’s provincial labour markets are less dissimilar today than at any point in at least the past 35 years. We find that reductions in the dispersion of provincial employment rates in the mid-1990s and 2000s are mostly concentrated among women and those in the 25 to 44 age group. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the tighter dispersion of employment rates has not been driven by stronger employment growth in previously weak regions of the country. Rather, it has mostly occurred as regional population growth has increasingly responded to labour market conditions. In other words, labour is being more efficiently reallocated to the regions of the country that have the tightest labour markets and away from those with excess labour supply. The dispersion of both unemployment and participation rates has fallen, contributing to this trend."

This projection is weaker than the one presented in the April 2015 Monetary Policy Report. Substantially softer business investment, largely due to much lower energy prices, causes the growth of trend labour productivity to be weaker. Weak business investment is the main negative shock to our projection. As investment picks up and the negative effects of the ongoing economic restructuring dissipate, we expect the growth of trend labour productivity to gradually increase toward its long-term average. Demographic developments are expected to contribute to gradually weaker trend labour input growth, however, which will act as a drag on the growth of potential output. A sensitivity analysis to various assumptions suggests a range for potential output that increases from about ±0.3 percentage points in 2016 to ±0.6 percentage points in 2018 and ±0.7 in 2019 and 2020."

Market-based indicators of leverage suggest that the solvency risk for major Canadian banks has increased since the beginning of the oil-price correction in the second half of 2014. This is in contrast to accounting-based leverage measures, which indicate a stable or improving trend. Similarly, measures of insolvency risk contingent on severe financial stress (i.e., market-based stress tests) indicate that the major banks are currently more vulnerable to a sudden adverse shock than they were in the summer of 2014. Finally, a measure of financial system interconnectedness and common exposures suggests a strong link between the major banks and the rest of the financial system, as expected. In other financial subsectors, the degree of interconnectedness has exhibited an upward trend over the last two decades."

We then assess whether wage growth is consistent with its fundamentals. Our analysis indicates that wage pressures remain subdued and almost all measures show that wage growth has remained below its historical average since mid-2015. With respect to the relationship between wage growth and its fundamentals, we find that the wages and total compensation growth was weaker than expected considering the rate of unemployment observed since 2015. This is partly due to the weak labour productivity growth. Finally, we observe that pressures on domestic production costs coming from wages remain modest."

This aggregate approach, however, may mask important sectoral changes. By further exploring some of the major CPI components (energy, food purchased from stores, goods excluding food and energy, and services), we identify the main sector-specific factors that led to the recent inflation dynamics. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of consumer energy prices has been an important source of downward pressure on total inflation, whereas the increases in the prices of food purchased from stores and of other goods have provided a partial offset. This upward pressure reflects, among other things, the effect of the temporary boost from the pass-through of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. Finally, the recent growth in services prices has been relatively subdued, owing in part to excess capacity and modest wage growth, which also contributed to the low total inflation rate."

Using data from Statistics Canada’s Quarterly Financial Statistics for the period 1999Q2–2015Q4, we report that, for example, an average WTI of $50 in 2016 would yield a 27.1 to 31.4 per cent (year over year) decline in fixed-asset cash spending in the sector relative to 2015."

The shares of involuntary part-time workers and long-term unemployment are high relative to the current stage of the business cycle, suggesting available labour inputs are being underutilized. Improvement in these areas could meaningfully increase US labour utilization and support economic growth. Another large potential source of labour market slack exists outside the labour force caused by the relatively low participation rate, which has fallen by more than 3 percentage points since 2007. Most analysis, including that in this note, finds that the aging population is an important factor behind this decline, indicating that there is less slack than implied by the drop in the headline participation rate. However, there is considerable uncertainty about whether the decline in participation unrelated to aging is driven by structural or cyclical phenomena and is therefore representative of slack. Nevertheless, a review of the historical experience suggests that a sizable number of persons outside the labour force could be “activated” and drawn back into the market under much “hotter” labour market conditions. But further research is needed to assess whether the historical relationship is a relevant guide in the current context."

A move toward agency trading would represent a change in the structure of Canadian bond markets and, in theory, could worsen some aspects of market liquidity. To assess the prevalence of agency trading in Canada, we use data from the Market Trade Reporting System to construct the first estimate of agency-based trading in Canadian bond markets. We find that agency trading is relatively uncommon across major segments of Canadian fixed-income market and that large bank broker-dealers are less likely than their smaller counterparts to trade as an agent."

The model decomposes price changes in commodities into a common “global” component, a “block” component confined to subgroups of economically related commodities and an idiosyncratic price shock component. Unlike with ordinary factor models, these components have meaningful economic interpretations: the global component mostly relates to global commodity demand shocks, while the idiosyncratic component mostly relates to commodity-specific supply shocks. We give several examples to show that the CFM provides plausible historical decompositions."

While the appropriate level for the inflation target remains an open question, it’s important to note that any transition to a new target would entail certain costs. In this note, we consider one dimension of these costs, namely, the redistributive effects stemming from the fact that financial contracts are often written in nominal terms and would thus experience changes in real value following the announcement of a new target. We use Canadian data on the distribution of nominal assets and liabilities to predict the redistribution of wealth that would occur following a permanent 1-percentage-point increase in the rate of inflation, both across sectors and between various demographic cohorts. We find that this change would trigger a large redistribution of wealth from the household sector to government, mainly through a reduction in the real value of government bonds and unindexed pensions. However, losses are unevenly distributed across the household sector, with a disproportionate share falling on middle-class and wealthier households. We also use a macro model to explore potential implications for output and find that these depend critically on the particular use to which the government directs its windfall."

Such was the case during the 2014–15 oil price shock, where valuation effects boosted Canada’s net international investment position (NIIP) by 30 per cent of GDP."

Recently, it has weakened further in several advanced economies despite gradually diminishing slack. This note reviews recent developments in core inflation across advanced economies and identifies distinctive patterns across regions. In many advanced economies outside of the United States, the decrease in core inflation started in 2016 and was driven primarily by goods prices—most likely because of lower export prices from China in 2016 and past exchange rate appreciations. In the United States, however, the decline in core inflation began in 2017 and has been driven mostly by service prices rather than goods prices. We estimate that roughly two-thirds of the softening in US core inflation may be due to idiosyncratic factors that are unlikely to persist, while the remaining one-third may be attributable to more persistent factors. We then examine the extent to which the persistent weakness in inflation after the global financial crisis can be explained by common factors across advanced economies. Our results suggest that global factors do not play much of a role in influencing domestic core inflation dynamics but that they remain important determinants of total inflation, acting mainly through the goods inflation channel—particularly through energy prices. Finally, we briefly investigate the relationship between economic slack and inflation. We find that the relationship between the output gap and core inflation remains positive, albeit modest, in advanced economies and that a significant share of the post-crisis weakness in inflation has been driven by domestic economic slack. In addition, we find that the relationship between the output gap and inflation is more evident with core services inflation than core goods inflation."

A global common factor for inflation among selected advanced economies appears to contain marginal information for Canadian inflation beyond what is found in movements in commodity prices and the exchange rate. However, our analysis of potential channels (import prices, global slack and the integration in global value chains) does not help to improve our understanding of the recent weakness in inflation. The analysis reinforces our current assessment that the weakness in inflation over recent quarters is mostly due to Canada-specific temporary factors (food and electricity prices). Still, there is a risk that part of the recent unexplained weakness in CPI inflation may not be due exclusively to Canada-specific factors, although the channels through which that global common factor operates remain undetermined. Further work is therefore needed to explore other channels (e.g., digitalization) through which the effect of this common factor might operate."

We find that while the size and timing of these effects are highly uncertain, the level of potential and real output could be almost 1 per cent higher than expected by the end of 2020. The resulting effect on the output gap and inflation is small and therefore does not affect the stance of monetary policy."

In this context, the Bank of Canada consulted with firms in wholesale, retail and logistics, as well as with related industry associations to yield insights on the adoption of digital technologies. Results show that firms are increasingly investing in digital technologies, most often to increase operational efficiency or to enhance customer experience. The survey also aimed to shed light on the various channels through which digital transformation may affect firms’ prices in order to discern the implications of digitalization for inflation. Survey respondents point to some disinflationary pressures overall: first, firms view e-commerce as putting downward pressure on prices, due to increased transparency and comparability in online markets, which amplifies competition and reduces firms’ pricing power. Second, thanks to the adoption of technologies, cost savings and efficiencies are in some cases being passed on to the customer although, for many firms, cost savings are yet to be realized. Finally, firms view digital technologies as a driver of actual or expected changes in market structure, citing consolidation and concentration of market power among dominant players, forcing smaller players out of the market."

We introduce a new “oil” portfolio that captures systematic variations when the exchange rates of commodity exporters and commodity importers move in opposite directions. We find that the Canadian dollar’s sensitivity to the oil portfolio has increased with the growing importance of commodities in the Canadian economy; this trend accelerated between 2007 and 2014. However, we find that only a small share of the depreciation of the Canadian dollar in 2014–15 can be attributed to the oil portfolio, even if this depreciation coincided with a sharp decline in oil prices."

In this note, we review the evidence found in the literature. We look at three main channels. First, we find that changes in the prices of information and communication technology-related goods and services included in the CPI have had a negligible effect on inflation in Canada. Second, we find that, due to the small share of e-commerce in Canada and the remarkably similar behaviour of online and offline prices, the “Amazon effect” has only had a small disinflationary impact to date. As e-commerce grows, however, downward pressure on inflation may amplify in the future through increased competition, but digitalization may also increase market concentration. Finally, although cost-efficient technologies should lead to increased productivity, which would put downward pressure on inflation, this effect has yet to appear in the statistics. Overall, we find it unlikely that digitalization has so far had a significant effect on inflation in Canada."

When the market perceives that the Bank of Canada plans to tighten (or alternatively, loosen) the monetary policy earlier than previously expected, the Canadian dollar appreciates (or depreciates) and long-term Government of Canada bond yields increase (or decrease). The tone of a statement is particularly relevant to the market when the policy rate has been unchanged for some time."

Using the approach proposed by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012), we find that roughly two-thirds of the total 1.2-percentage-point increase in corporate bond spreads from July 2014 to September 2016—a period when oil prices were low—is due to higher compensation for possible default. Default risk explains most of the increase of spreads for energy and high-yield firms but explains almost none of the increase for financial and investment-grade firms. This suggests that liquidity risk and other factors beyond possible default affected spreads of financial and other investment-grade firms."

While there is considerable uncertainty surrounding our estimates, overall we expect global potential output growth to rise modestly, from 3.1 per cent in 2016 to 3.4 per cent in 2019. This gradual increase is expected to be broad-based, reflecting growth-enhancing reforms in oil-importing emerging-market economies (excluding China) and in the euro area and the diminishing drag on investment in commodity-producing regions stemming from the 2014–15 decline in commodity prices. Potential output growth in the United States is expected to rise modestly through 2019 driven by a small recovery in trend total factor productivity growth. China is the only major economy where potential output growth is expected to slow, albeit moderately, as it gradually transitions to a more sustainable growth path featuring slower investment growth."

Our analysis indicates that slack remains in the Canadian labour market, while the US labour market is close to full employment. Canada’s negative labour input gap reflects weak average hours worked, whereas aggregate employment is getting close to its trend. In the United States, in contrast to Canada, both the level of employment and average hours worked are currently estimated to be at trend. The decomposition of the growth of average hours worked for Canada suggests that its overall decline is broad-based within each type of work (full-time/part-time), worker characteristics (region/age/sex) and sector (goods/services)."

Potential output growth is projected to increase from 1.3 per cent in 2017 to 1.6 per cent by 2020. The lower estimate for potential output growth in the near term (relative to the 2016 assessment) largely reflects distinctly weak business investment over 2015 and 2016, as well as reallocation costs associated with the adjustment to lower oil prices. However, potential output growth improves throughout the projection as investment is expected to pick up, with an increasing share in productivity-enhancing machinery and equipment. Population aging will act as a drag on potential output growth, with a small offset coming from higher levels of immigration. An analysis of alternative scenarios suggests a range of potential output growth from ±0.3 percentage points in 2017 to ±0.5 percentage points in 2020."

This note studies whether DNWR can lead to a long‐run trade‐off between inflation and unemployment, especially at lower rates of inflation—a question that has important implications for the optimal level of inflation in the long run. The results suggest that the trade‐off between unemployment and inflation remains weak despite the estimated increase in DNWR. In particular, the long‐run Phillips curve is close to vertical at inflation rates of 2 per cent or more, in line with earlier findings (Crawford and Wright 2001). As a result, an increase in long‐term inflation from 2 to 3 per cent would lower unemployment by about 0.1–0.2 percentage points. Overall, our results suggest that the benefits of raising the inflation target to attain a lower long‐term unemployment level seem rather weak."

Several recent studies have attributed a large part of the weakness in business investment to cyclical factors, including soft aggregate demand, and, to a lesser degree, heightened uncertainty and tighter financial conditions. In contrast, our analysis suggests that structural factors could provide an alternative explanation for the observed weakness in Canadian business investment. As a result, there is a risk that this weakness could prove to be much more persistent than cyclical interpretations suggest. Overall, population aging combined with two factors that could prove to be structural—weak productivity growth and the 2014–15 collapse in oil prices—could plausibly reduce the investment-to-output ratio by as much as 2 percentage points by 2020 relative to the average of 12 per cent observed since 2000, or an additional 0.9 percentage points relative to its 2016 value. This would have important implications for the economic outlook."

Our analysis indicates that ongoing labour market slack and, to a lesser extent, weak labour productivity growth appear to be key factors weighing on wage growth since 2014 in Canada. The decline in commodity prices may also be a key factor that contributed to subdued Canadian wage growth. A comparative analysis of US wage growth is also conducted. In the United States, weak labour productivity growth is a key macro factor weighing on wage growth, but labour market slack is no longer a material drag."

The growth in the US participation rate has largely been due to a pickup in the participation of prime-age workers following a post-recession decline. The prime-age participation rate in Canada, however, did not experience a significant drop following the 2008–09 recession, suggesting that the scope for drawing more prime-age workers into the Canadian labour force is more limited than in the United States. This does not preclude the possibility that the Canadian participation rate could rebound for other reasons, however. Indeed, the Canadian youth participation rate fell following the recession and could potentially recover in response to stronger labour market conditions. While the US youth participation rate also fell following the recession, this continued a long-standing trend decline in this rate, which suggests the recent drop in the United States could be more permanent."
